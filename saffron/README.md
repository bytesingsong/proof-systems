# Saffron - a solution for mutable state management for Web3

This crate provides a binary (`saffron`) and utilities to manage efficiently a
mutable state using succinct proofs (SNARK).

## Binary

Current Features
- Encode and decode data into polynomials.
- Compute a commitment for given input data.
- Create a storage proof for given data.
- Verify the correctness of a storage proof.

## Usage

Run `cargo run --release --bin saffron -- --help` for the list of features with the appropriate arguments.

## Test

We provide an e2e test showing all the features executed sequentially in
`./test-encoding.sh`. Use `./test-encoding.sh fixtures/lorem.txt`.
